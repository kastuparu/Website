	<p>Science and Technical Writing (STW) is taught by Dr. Crowthers. He also teaches
		<a class = "links" href = "projects-stemI.html">STEM I</a> and <a class = "links" href = "projects-stemII.html">
			STEM II,</a> which are to help us develop our STEM projects. STW is a class where we work on developing the
		skills needed for STEM projects, such as learning how to effectively research, take notes, and produce a piece
		of writing.</p>
	<p>In November, I created a Project Proposal for my STEM I project which includes all the background information
		necessary for regional and state approval before starting testing. My project notes document was where I took
		notes on all the research I did for my project, helping me keep organized for my literature review. The
		literature review explains all the background information that is necessary for my project. In January, we
		researched a statistical test to present for the class so that we could learn about statistics to use in our
		STEM I projects. My group members (Rachel and Daiwik) and I learned about Spearman's Rank Correlation test, used
		to show the relationship between two monotonic variables.</p>
