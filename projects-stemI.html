	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>Alcohol metabolism is known to impair the functions of several body systems. The experiment
		discovered how metabolic processes of ethanol in <i>D. melanogaster</i> affect the ability of the
		reproductive system to produce offspring. It was hypothesized that if the rate of the metabolism of
		ethanol increases, then the number of healthy offspring produced will decrease because the toxic
		molecules and free radicals produced when ethanol is broken down will lead to oxidative stress which
		is known to lower the functionality of the body and raise the risk of disease. Flies were split into
		seven groups (including control), with each vial containing 5, 10, or 15 percent ethanol in the
		liquid mixed with the <i>Drosophila</i> medium. Female flies received ethanol at different stages:
		during gestation or during mating and gestation. It was found that the flies in vials with a higher
		concentration of ethanol were unable to lay as many eggs as the flies in vials with the natural
		amount of ethanol or no ethanol. It is suggested that the metabolism of ethanol in
		<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> inhibits the typical functions of the reproductive system due to the
		increased level of ethanol metabolism. Although <i>D. melanogaster</i> and humans are structurally
		different, it is expected that consuming large amounts of ethanol can similarly reduce the
		functionality of the human reproductive system.</p>

	<h3>Research Question</h3>
	<p>How do the metabolic processes of ethanol in <i>D. melanogaster</i> affect the ability of the
		reproductive system to produce offspring?</p>

	<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
	<p>If the rate of the metabolism of ethanol increases, then the number of healthy offspring produced
		will decrease because the toxic molecules and free radicals produced when ethanol is broken down
		will lead to oxidative stress which is known to lower the functionality of the body and raise the
		risk of disease.</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>It is a well-known fact that the consumption of alcohol can do great damage to the human body.
		Many studies have been done to show that those who have a higher intake of alcohol are more
		susceptible to malfunctions throughout the body. Some of these effects are cancer, epilepsy, and
		heart disease. These risks may have other attributing factors but have an association with
		drinking (Rehm, 2011). In the last two decades, scientists have begun to look at the deeper
		causes of these diseases and have studied the way that ethanol affects the body at the molecular
		level. They discovered how the body reacts to small and large amounts of ethanol and understood
		why it can put the body at a health risk. While they found positive correlations between alcohol
		intake and the risk of many specific diseases, many of the causes remained unknown. What
		scientists did find, however, is an understanding of how ethanol is broken down in the body and
		how it can cause disease in a more general case.</p>
	<p>When alcohol is taken into the body, it is absorbed into the bloodstream, mainly through the
		stomach and the small intestine. The ethanol in the blood gets delivered to many places around
		the body. In these places, primarily the liver, alcohol dehydrogenase works to break down the
		ethanol into acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is an extremely toxic substance that can cause many
		diseases or malfunctions of the body. A chemical reaction with another enzyme, aldehyde
		dehydrogenase, eliminates the acetaldehyde and produces acetate. When a surplus of ethanol is in
		the body, the function of alcohol dehydrogenase increases to accommodate, producing acetaldehyde
		at a faster rate. However, the rate at which aldehyde dehydrogenase works stays the same, so the
		result is an excess amount of acetaldehyde which remains in the body for hours until it is
		broken down. When this occurs often, it becomes especially dangerous for the body as
		acetaldehyde is unsafe (NIAAA Publications, n.d.).</p>
	<img class = "floatleft" alt = "Introduction infographic" src = "projects-stemI/Introduction.png" style = "width: 30%;">
	<p> In addition to this, the reaction of acetaldehyde with tissues produces free radicals (Comporti
		et al., 2010). Free radicals, a byproduct of a metabolic process, are chemically unstable
		molecules, meaning that they are very reactive. The body balances these toxins out with
		antioxidants, but when there are too many free radicals, the ratio of the toxins to antioxidants
		becomes too high. In this way, the reactive oxygen species can damage parts of cells. This
		situation, called oxidative stress, occurs when an excess of alcohol is consumed. When the body
		breaks down the large amounts of ethanol, it reaches a point where the free radical to
		antioxidant ratio becomes too high, increasing the risk for diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s,
		Parkinson’s, and more (Zima et al., 2001).</p>
	<p>Recently, scientists have worked to understand how the metabolism of ethanol affects different
		areas of the body or the chances of contracting a certain disease. One study found that the
		consumption of ethanol led to lowered fertility rates in male rats. This was because of the
		accumulation of acetaldehyde and 1-hydroxyethyl in testes where ethanol metabolism occurred
		damaged the organ’s ability to produce sperm (Quintans et al., 2005). Female fertility was also
		found to be lowered by ethanol when scientists found structural change and malfunctions to the
		ovaries of female rats (Faut et al., 2009). In another study, researchers discovered that the
		metabolism of ethanol in the uterine horn of female rats caused damage to the uterus for similar
		reasons (Buthet et al., 2011). The breaking down of ethanol even in small amounts can change the
		function of many organs in the body (not just the liver where it is primarily metabolized),
		particularly reproductive organs. However, it is not well known how the metabolism of ethanol
		affects the functionality of the reproductive system as a whole.</p>
	<p>Studies have also used Drosophila melanogaster, which is a type of fruit fly commonly used as a
		model organism in scientific experiments. Although the structure of <i>D. melanogaster</i> and humans
		is different, the disease-related genes among both species are 75 percent alike (Ugur et al.,
		2016), so the effect of ethanol on the flies may be applicable to humans as well. However, it
		is important to note that <i>D. melanogaster</i> thrive with a small amount of ethanol in their diet,
		as found in nature. Similar studies done with the rats have also been done with <i>D. melanogaster.</i>
		For example, it was discovered that ethanol intake during the gestation period affects the lipid
		regulation of offspring, which can be used to model fetal alcohol syndrome in humans
		(Logan-Garbisch et al., 2014). With <i>D. melanogaster</i> as a model organism, the effects of ethanol
		on the functionality of reproductive system can be researched. Using the knowledge about how
		ethanol affects the body, it is hypothesized that female <i>D. melanogaster</i> will produce offspring
		in greater numbers if less alcohol is consumed. The following study looks at the potential
		interference that the consumption of ethanol has with the production of offspring.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<img class = "floatright" alt = "Procedure infographic" src = "projects-stemI/Methodology.png" style = "width: 30%;">
	<p>To test the effect of ethanol on the reproductive system, <i>D. melanogaster</i> were placed into several
		vials with the medium containing varying concentrations of ethanol. The flies were given ethanol
		during gestation or gestation and mating. The vials were set up and the flies were anesthetized
		and handled using standard procedures. After two weeks, the number of pupae and visible larvae
		were counted and the mean number of pupae and larvae per adult female fly in each experimental
		group was calculated. A two-sample t-test was performed.</p>
	<p>First, fifteen cylindrical vials with a height of 4 in. and a diameter of 1.25 in. were prepared.
		<i>D. melanogaster</i> medium was placed at the bottom of the vial with an even amount of distilled water
		(mixed with ethanol) poured on top. Ethanol with 40 percent concentration was used. The liquid
		poured into each vial had a concentration of 0, 5, or 15 percent. Additionally, a small amount of
		baker’s yeast was sprinkled on top of the medium to aid growth.</p>
	<p>A vial of <i>D. melanogaster</i> for experimental use provided the organisms. After transporting the flies
		to a separate vial and anesthetizing them for about a minute (until most had fell asleep), they
		were sorted into males and females. Five females were placed into each of the seven vials, while
		three males were placed only into the control vial (0 percent ethanol) and half of each type of
		the experimental vials (into one 5 percent vial and one 15 percent vial). The vials were all
		labeled with the concentration of ethanol in the liquid as well as the stage that females received
		ethanol: gestation for the vials with just females and gestation and mating for the vials with
		females and males.</p>
	<p>After two weeks, the number of pupae and visible larvae produced in each vial were counted. The
		number of adult flies was recorded as well. The qualitative conditions in each vial were also made
		note of. A two-sample t-test was done comparing the mean number of pupae produced per adult female
		fly from the 5 percent group to the 15 percent group.</p>

	<h2>Figures</h2>

	<h3>Table 1: Number of Eggs Produced per Vial</h3>
	<p>The results from the experiment, the number of eggs produced by 5 adult female <i>D. melanogaster,</i>
		are shown below for control groups and groups receiving 5 and 15 percent ethanol during gestation or
		gestation and mating.</p>
	<img class = "imgnobordercenter" alt = "Table 1" src = "projects-stemI/Table.png" style = "width: 75%;">

	<h3>Figure 1: Mean Number of Pupae and Larvae per Concentration of Ethanol</h3>
	<p>The values from Table 1 are shown, comparing the average amount of eggs that 5 adult
		female <i>D. melanogaster</i> produce per ethanol concentration.</p>
	<img class = "imgnobordercenter" alt = "Figure 1" src = "projects-stemI/Graph.png" style = "width: 60%;">

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The groups with gestation and mating were not used in the significance test because the male sexual
		behavior during mating is known to be affected by ethanol (Shohat-Ophir et al., 2012). A 2-sample t-test
		comparing the control group to the 15 percent gestation group produced a t-value of 9.92484 and a P-value
		of 0.000289, less than 0.05. Therefore, it can be concluded that the difference between the number of eggs
		produced in the control group compared to the 15 percent ethanol during gestation group is statistically
		significant. </p>

	<h2>Discussion</h2>
	<p>The results supported the hypothesis that an increased rate of the metabolism of ethanol of <i>D. melanogaster</i>
		results in fewer offspring being produced. When the fruit flies ingested higher concentrations of ethanol,
		the number of pupae and countable larvae produced after two weeks was significantly lower than the number of
		offspring produced by flies consuming little to no ethanol. Flies consuming high amounts of ethanol were not
		able to successfully reproduce due to the free radicals that accumulated in their body. When great amounts of
		ethanol are broken down, acetaldehyde is formed and creates free radicals. These unstable molecules damage
		reproductive tissue and inhibit its typical function (NIAAA Publications, n.d.). It is possible that the free
		radicals affected the general health rather than the reproductive system itself; however, studies done with rats
		discovered the presence of ethanol metabolism in various reproductive organs
		(Quintans et al., 2005; Faut et al., 2009; Buthet et al., 2011). Overall, it is concluded that higher ethanol
		metabolism rates in <i>D. melanogaster</i> inhibit the ability to produce offspring.</p>
	<p>The fruit flies that received a 5 percent concentration of ethanol in the liquid mixed with medium were able to
		reproduce just as well (if not better) than the control group. This finding is because evolutionarily,
		<i>D. melanogaster</i> have developed a small resistance to the toxicities of ethanol. In nature,
		<i>D. melanogaster</i> thrive in ethanol concentrations as high as 6 or 7 percent. These flies benefit from
		the extra calories and antimicrobial properties from rotting fruit, giving them an advantage over other species
		(Pohl et al., 2012). Thus, the flies which are adapted to small amounts of ethanol were able to reproduce well
		when consuming 5 percent ethanol concentration of liquid.</p>
	<p>During the first trial of testing, mold formed inside many vials, which likely impacted the general health of
		the flies and thus reproduction. Therefore, the data from that round of testing cannot be used to support the
		results due to the possibility of confounding variables and uncontrollable conditions. </p>
	<p>The result that more ethanol metabolism decreases the functionality of the reproductive system in <i>D. melanogaster</i>
		may also be applicable to humans. The two species may react similarly to the effects of free radicals, due
		to the 75 percent similarity in genes relating to disease (Ugur et al., 2016). Although fruit flies and humans
		likely have varying responses to certain concentrations of ethanol, the idea that great amounts of ethanol
		consumed relative to that species’ ethanol tolerance and resistance cause the reproductive system to malfunction
		likely holds true.</p>
	<p>This experiment discovered that high rates of ethanol metabolism cause for <i>D. melanogaster</i> to be unable
		to produce as many offspring compared to no ethanol metabolism. The contribution of the study lies in its
		conclusion that ethanol consumption leads to an inhibited production of offspring. The general results are
		extendable to humans. The consumption of ethanol is widely known to have a negative effect on the body; more
		specifically, it is important to note that alcohol lowers the ability to create offspring.</p>
