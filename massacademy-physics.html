    <p>Physics, taught my Mr. Ellis, was one of my favorite classes because I loved the focus around
        problem-solving. We learned about kinematics, forces, energy, rotational motion, electricity, and magnetism.
        The class had options for algebra-based physics and calculus-based physics. I challenged myself to learn the
        calculus and to take the AP Physics C exam.</p>

    <h2>Über Problems: Kinematics and Forces</h2>

    </div>
    <p>One of the opportunities to use calculus is in the Über problem at the end of a unit. Über
        problems are multi-stage, often combining all the topics that we have covered so far. Each
        student also uses different given information. For the kinematics unit, we did an Über rocket
        problem where the goal was to calculate the total time. The challenging part was accounting
        for the terminal velocity in the final stage. The forces problem we did was Über pulley where
        we had to find the coefficient of friction of a surface based on how an item was launched.
        The beginning stage which involved a chain on a pulley (meaning the objects on the pulley have
        changing masses) was the most challenging for me.</p>

    <h2>Electrostatics: Electric Potential Labs</h2>
    <div class="floatleft" style="width: 100%;">

    </div>
    <p>When beginning our electrostatics unit, we modeled electric potential in Excel to get a better understanding
        of the concept. For the first portion of the lab, we created tables and graphs of the electric potential
        near a positive and negative charge. The second part of the lab used conditional formatting and several
        Excel graphs to show electric potential near four positive and one negative charge.</p>
