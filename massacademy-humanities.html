    <p>Humanities is a combination of a high school English and history class, taught by Ms. Small.
        For homework, we read short stories or selections from books and the following day had discussions about
        themes from the reading or ideas we found interesting. These discussions were my favorite part of the
        class because I got to share my thoughts with my classmates and to hear and respond to
        theirs as well. Learning about other perspectives from my classmates gave me much more insight
        on the topics we were learning about. In humanities, we also work on improved our writing skills. We
        had weekly journals and often wrote responses or essays. To the right is an image of me at Walden Pond, the
        location of Henry David Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, a book our class read. Below are three of the essays I wrote
        for class.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Wildfong’s language classes at Mass Academy, which are Spanish and French, are
        immersion-based. At my sending school, I took Latin for four years in middle and high school.
        At Mass Academy, I studied French. I found the transition between languages natural because it is a
        Romance language (I had already spoken Romanian at home and knew thousands of Latin words).
        I did a lot of French practice on the
        <a class=links target="_blank" href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/katystuparu">Duolingo</a>
        language learning app, which helped me learn the basic grammar and vocabulary. In class, we focused on speaking
        French, practicing pronunciation and fluidity. Homework consisted of reading or writing in French. We also had
        a vocabulary and listening journal, in which we kept track of a few French vocabulary words that we learned each
        day and wrote about French movies, songs, or podcasts that we listened to twice a week. Below I have included my
        presentation for a French recipe that I cooked.</p>

        <h2>Ray Bradbury Essay</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-humanities/BradburyEssay.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>The first one was written in September and compared two of Ray Bradbury’s short stories,
            <a class="links" target="_blank"
               href="https://www.btboces.org/Downloads/7_There%20Will%20Come%20Soft%20Rains%20by%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf">
                “August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains”</a> and
            <a class="links" target="_blank"
               href="https://www.tesd.net/cms/lib/PA01001259/Centricity/Domain/542/The%20Pedestrian%20by%20Ray%20Bradbury.pdf">
                “The Pedestrian,”</a>
            written in 1950. They both dealt with the future of humanity being
            overcome by technology.</p>

        <h2>Rhetorical Analysis Essay</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-humanities/RhetoricalAnalysisEssay.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>My next essay was about comparing the effectiveness of two pieces that argue for animal rights:
            <a class="links" target="_blank"
               href="https://maitreyiananth.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/babycakes-a-short-story-by-neil-gaiman-9-2/">
                “Babycakes”</a> by Neil Gaiman and a <i>BBC</i> article titled
            <a class="links" target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/animals/rights/rights_1.shtml">“Animal
                Rights.”</a>
            “Babycakes” is a satirical piece proposing that when the world runs out of animals, babies
            should be used in their place. “Animal Rights” takes an approach appealing more to logos and
            ethos because it presents logical arguments for supporting animal rights while quoting many
            intellectuals.</p>

        <h2>Science Fiction Essay</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-humanities/ScienceFictionEssay.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>The final topic we covered in humanities class was science fiction. My essay discussed how early-mid
            20th century sci-fi warned people of a future filled with the present-day wars through fear. I utilized
            several short stories we read in class, such as Alfred Bester's "Adam and No Eve," "Second Variety" by
            Philip K. Dick, and an adaptation of "The War of Worlds" read by Orson Welles.</p>
