    <h2>Tutoring</h2>
    <p>In my junior year at MAMS, I chose tutoring for my community service opportunity. Each week, I spent two hours on
        average helping an elementary school child with math and English homework through Lightbulb Tutoring, a virtual
        tutoring service in Westford, MA. With me, my student primarily worked on Russian School of Math homework and
        Kumon English, occasionally on some schoolwork. First, my student attempted the problem. After explaining how
        she thought through the question, I checked if the answer was correct. I gave her tips for how she could improve
        her problem-solving strategies and explained the steps for doing challenging problems. Throughout the program,
        my student improved her math, reading, and writing skills along with her thinking and visualization strategies.</p>
    <p>My community service experience in junior year got me involved with tutoring for the first time. I chose to tutor
        because I wanted to help students understand the concepts they were learning better, and I wanted to prevent
        unnecessary struggling with difficult material that can occur especially during remote learning. After tutoring
        for elementary school for over a year, I realized not only how much my student’s skills grew, but mine as well.
        Through long problems where it was difficult for me to explain my thoughts to my student, my patience grew
        significantly. I also gained insight on understanding how others think about mathematical concepts and interpret
        a book or short story. Discussing academic ideas in different ways not only helped me understand my student’s
        thought processes but also forced me to be more flexible in how I thought and talked about what my student was
        learning. My tutoring experience was extremely meaningful for both me and my student.</p>
    <p>The time I spent tutoring benefited my student because it helped her achieve her academic goals and remain
        motivated during the long quarantine period of COVID-19. Lockdowns affected the learning experience of many
        children, especially young students. Through isolation from teachers and friends, elementary students struggled
        to find incentive to stay on top of schoolwork. I believe that tutoring sessions helped my student to learn in a
        difficult and unprecedented learning environment and challenged her to study subjects at a high level.</p>
    <p>Tutoring is an extremely valuable service opportunity for multiple reasons. First, it is a great way to show
        support for students. Everyone has struggled to learn something at some point, so providing a resource to help
        for free is great for students. Finally, tutoring helps open the teacher’s mind to different ways of thinking
        and understanding academic material. I recommend tutoring to anyone hoping to improve students’ experiences and
        gain some experience teaching. I would like to continue tutoring young children and begin teaching older
        students too.</p>
