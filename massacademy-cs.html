    <p>In CS, Mrs. Taricco has taught us how to use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS
        (Cascading Style Sheets) while creating our own personal websites. We also learned how
        to code Java programs. We wrote many programs in each unit to help us develop problem-solving
        and logical thinking skills. Below are two of my favorite programs, which involved utilizing
        Applets (Java version 1.8). Visit my <a class="links" href="projects-apps4good.html">Apps for Good</a>
        page to learn about my group application project I did in D term.</p>

        <h2>LineArtGraphics</h2>
        <p>LineArtGraphics is a class that creates an image with only straight lines.
            It was the lab for the Iterations unit when we learned about for and while loops. For this lab,
            I controlled the start and end point of each line using an (x, y) coordinate that has a fixed
            part and an incremented or decremented (by a constant value) part. Inside of the original
            drawing, I sized down the original and positioned it in the center of the drawing.</p>

        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <img alt="Randomized stars" src="massacademy-cs/Stars.png" style="width: 80%;">
        <p>Stars was my favorite exercise from the Static Arrays unit in which we learned
            how to use Arrays. The program prints ten stars of a random size, location, and color. I created
            a variable for size and center of the star and used those with trigonometric ratios to pinpoint
            the location of each point of the star. Creating random RGB values allowed me to color in each
            star, making it more visually appealing.</p>
