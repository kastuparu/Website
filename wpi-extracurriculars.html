	<br>
	<p>I've been on <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://wp.wpi.edu/frc190/">Team 190</a>, a FIRST Robotics
		Competition team, since 2020. I was on the team as a Mass Academy student and am now a mentor for the team as a
		WPI student. As a student, I worked on mechanical design, manufacturing, and programming. At events, I led our
		scouting team and presented our team for the Impact Award. As a mentor, I've been teaching students the skills
		I learned when I was a student and what I learned from my coursework at WPI as a CS and RBE major.</p>
	<p>This past season, our team faced many ups and downs, including our robot snapping in half during the elimination
		matches at the WPI District event! We ended the season competing at the FRC World Championships in Houston.
		During the season, I created a scouting software, GompeiScout (named after WPI's mascot Gompei), for our team
		to use to collect and analyze data about other robots. Keeping track of this data helps us create winning
		strategies and know what to expect when playing with or against other teams. Check out the code on

	<h2>Mass Academy 2020-2022</h2>

	<h3>Math Team</h3>
	<p>Math Team at Mass Academy gives students the opportunity to practice and participate
		in math competitions. I mainly competed in <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.wocomal.org/">WOCOMAL</a>
		(Worcester County Math League) and the
		<a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions/amc-1012">AMC 12 A and B</a> during
		junior year.</p>

	<h3>CyberPatriot</h3>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">
		<img id="floatrightnoborder" alt="CyberPatriot logo" src="wpi-images/Cyberpatriot.jpg" style="width: 20%;"></a>
	<p>CyberPatriot is a computer science extracurricular activity during B and C terms which is all about securing a
		computer or server. This involves creating firewalls, ensuring that the correct users can log in, creating
		settings for secure passwords, setting up certain services, and so much more. My team (Ronit, Jon, Andrew,
		Shreya, and Ansh) and I worked on Windows, Windows Server, Ubuntu, and Debian as well as a packet
		tracer and networking quiz. I worked mainly on the Ubuntu image. I enjoyed competing during my junior year, in
		which my team were in the gold division, and my senior year, in which my team ranked #3 in the Massachusetts
		platinum division.</p>

	<h3>Tennis</h3>
	<p>I have been playing tennis since I was six years old. I started by taking the classes that
		were offered in my town. My favorite part about the sport back then was the aspect of
		independence. Tennis relies very much on the individual player having good technique and
		coming up with an impeccable strategy. I also enjoyed playing with other people. As I grew
		older, I spent the weekends connecting with family and friends and enjoying the sunshine
		outside through tennis.</p>
	<img class = "floatright" alt = "The team at the end of the season" src = "wpi-images/Tennis.jpg" style = "width: 50%;">
	<p>When I got to high school and joined the tennis team there, I began to work a lot more on
		my tennis skills. We practiced five days a week, focusing on running (endurance), footwork,
		the technique of the strokes, holding a rally, and game strategy. The practices were hard work,
		but it allowed me to improve very much as a tennis player. After practice, the tennis team
		would sometimes hang out, especially if it was the night before a match. We would go to
		Kimball Farm for ice cream, a local restaurant, or have a spaghetti dinner at one of our
		houses. Over the weekends, we would go out and play tennis with each other for fun, to improve
		our skills, and spend time with each other.</p>
	<p>The matches were extremely fun, too! We would all compete with all that we had in our
		matches, and play great games. From each match, I would learn a lot about how different
		strategies worked and how I could improve my technique to play more effectively. My doubles
		partner and I improved our game through the season and got extremely close. We knew what move
		the other person was going to make and knew how to lift each other up. Overall, tennis has
		helped me develop a growth-oriented mindset and a love for the balance between individual and
		teamwork.</p>

	<h3>Choir</h3>
	<p>In fifth grade, I joined the chorus at my elementary school. Once a week, we would meet
		before school and sing together, preparing for a concert and celebrating music with one
		another. Ever since then, I have continued singing in a choir. As I began to sing more and
		gain experience, I realized many small details about how a choir comes together. The harmonies
		between each voice part could come together to bring one big sound filling the auditorium.
		If every individual singer knew their part and sang expressively, the choir could produce
		beautiful music. Besides singing with other people, I enjoyed practicing on my own and playing
		around with the rhythms and chords with my voice and on the piano. This helped me to better
		understand the song and what the final sound was supposed to be like. Something else I began
		to take notice of was the balance between individual voices and the overall sound product.
		The singers in one section had to find the same dynamic and vowel shape to sing with, and the
		four sections (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) had to find a balance between the varying
		pitches. Taking the composer’s instructions and bringing them to life as a choir could
		produce the most wonderful sounds that could ever be heard.</p>
	<img class = "floatleft" alt = "The Westford Academy choir at Carnegie Hall" src = "wpi-images/Choir.jpg" style = "width: 50%;">
	<p>Performing with the whole choir was like being in a different world. The feeling of
		singing on stage, surrounded by the people that love making music with you, is so wonderful.
		All of the emotions and colors of the music come flowing out to make such a beautiful and
		expressive sound. My favorite performance was with the Westford Academy choir at Carnegie
		Hall. We joined many other schools to form one large choir, and had a moment to sing our own
		piece, “Earth Song” by Frank Ticheli. I’m so grateful to have had the opportunity to perform
		in such a beautiful place with my classmates whom I worked hard for two years with to produce
		beautiful music.

	<h3>Piano</h3>

	</div>
	<p>When I was in elementary school, I began to take piano lessons. My favorite things to play
		were the scales. I was fascinated with the way that notes sounded together and how chords
		were built, even at the most basic level. During practicing, I would take ten or twenty
		minutes to just play around with the music that came from pressing different keys. As I grew
		older, I fell in love with the various emotions that each key signature could show, and how
		that could be amplified with the use of dynamics and expression. The works that I am most proud
		of are "Nocturne" by Billy Joel and the first movement of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata."
		Both videos are of me performing at the Parish Center for the Arts in Westford, MA.</p>
