    <p>I've been taking classes at Worcester Polytechnic Institute since the fall of 2021, my senior year at Mass
        Academy, when I dual-enrolled at WPI. I'm working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
        Robotics Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science. I aim to graduate in 2026. Below are some
        coursework highlights from the classes I've taken so far. All course descriptions can be found
        <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://courselistings.wpi.edu/">here</a>.</p>

    <h2> Computer Science Coursework</h2>

    <h3>CS 2011 - Introduction to Machine Organization and Assembly Language</h3>
    <p>This course gave me a lot of insight about the structure and behavior of digital computers. I learned through
        three projects: Datalab (puzzles for 32-bit integers and 32-bit floats to be completed only with boolean
        operators), Bomblab (stepping through the x86-64 disassembly to learn how a program works), and Attacklab
        (exploiting programs through code injection and return-oriented programming) (code available upon request).</p>

    <h3>CS 2303 - Systems Programming Concepts</h3>
    <p>This course introduced me to programming in C and C++ and to the details of how hardware stores and executes
        software. I learned about memory management, pointers, the stack, and the heap through several projects (code
        available upon request).</p>

    <h3>CS 2103 - Accelerated Object-Oriented Design Concepts</h3>
    <p>This course covered object-oriented design principles and data structures at an accelerated pace. Some of these
        topics include abstract classes, abstract data types, inner classes (static and non-static), anonymous classes,
        type-safety and casting, stacks, queues, graphs, hashmaps, trees, heaps and priority queues, binary search
        trees, and expression trees and grammars. I learned how to implement these design concepts in Java through
        several projects (code available upon request).</p>

    <h3>CS 1102 - Accelerated Introduction to Program Design</h3>
    <p>This course taught me to look at program design through a new lens. I learned about lists, iterations, functions,
        recursion, mutual recursion, generative recursion, tail recursion, lambda functions, binary search trees, AVL
        trees, graphs, and macros through several projects in Racket (code available upon request).  </p>

    <h2>Robotics Engineering Coursework</h2>

    <h3>RBE 1001 - Introduction to Robotics Engineering</h3>
    <p>In this course, I learned the basics to robotics engineering through designing and programming a VEX robot with
        my team to climb up a ramp and score game pieces when teleoperated and autonomously. I learned how to design and
        analyze electric circuits, use static analysis to determine torque and power requirements, and write programs
        for performing tasks that involve sensors and actuators.</p>

    <h2>Other Coursework</h2>
    <p>To help me build skills required for higher level CS and RBE classes, I've been taking classes in electrical
        engineering, static systems, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (multivariable calculus, ordinary differential
        equations, linear algebra, statistics, probability, and discrete math). I've also been taking humanities
        classes in creative writing, English literature, philosophy, psychology, and social science.</p>
