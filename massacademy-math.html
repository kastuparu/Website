    <p>Mass Academy’s math class, taught by Mr. Regele, is all about developing problem-solving
        skills and learning about mathematical modeling. In class, we worked individually or in groups
        to improve our problem solving skills. Throughout the year, we did problems from Exeter’s Book 2
        and 3 as well as PCMI PROMYS to become familiar with mathematical concepts needed for calculus.</p>

        <h2>Triangle of Evens and Odds</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-math/TriangleProof.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>On the first day of school, the problem that we worked on in class was proving that every row after
            the second row in a triangle of numbers contains an entry which is even. The triangle is
            formed by summing the cell above it and the two cells immediately to the left and right of
            the cell above it (except the top which is 1).</p>

        <p>In November, we competed in the
            <a class="links" target="_blank" href="https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/index.html">HiMCM
                (High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling),</a>
            which is a 36-hour math modeling competition. The final product is a paper written to explain the modeling
            solution. My team members (<a class="links" target="_blank" href="http://users.wpi.edu/~ravadhuta/">Ronit</a>
            and Nick) and I decided to choose the first problem because although we anticipated that the mathematical
            analysis was more complex, the second problem required more data organization. We thought our team of three
            (most teams had four) would have a higher chance of success with the problem focused around mathematical
            analysis. My team had a lot of fun with the HiMCM and is proud of our solution!</p>

        <h2>Conic Art</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-math/Conicart.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>The conic art assignment was an especially fun one, in which we got to draw anything of our choice using
            parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, and sinusoidal functions with no straight lines allowed. I chose to draw
            the Among Us emergency meeting logo. My design relied the most on ellipses and parabolas.

        <h2>Painted Tetrahedron</h2>
        <iframe src="massacademy-math/Tetrahedron.pdf" style="width: 95%;"></iframe>
        <p>The painted tetrahedron was one of the final problems we worked on during the school year. The question posed
            a situation where a large tetrahedron was dipped in paint and then cut into unit tetrahedra. In the end, I
            found out the number of smaller tetrahedra and octahedra with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 sides covered in paint based
            on side length n of the large tetrahedron.
